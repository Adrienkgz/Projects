All my public personnal projects

Here are a resume for all my public project :

This software can also create an environment following gym conventions and also contains machine learning algorithms (This version is an update of a previous version and does not yet contain all the features mentioned).
- Cartpole-V1 : Cartpole DQN resolved to never loose

This is not all my project, some project are private because they are for company with sensitive data
