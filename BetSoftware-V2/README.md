The majority of the code is used to scrap the matches data from some website
Caution : Please do not initiate a scrap of a league on the websites as it could lead to server overload.

After this, we want to create an environnement to train an agent to bet to maximise the profit
Finnally, we will create a WebApp to show to users whats the best matches to bet on.

Note: This project is a redesign of an older project to make it more efficient and better structured
